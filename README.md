## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript
- Git version control
- Command Line


### What I learned

#### JavaScript
This is my first JavaScript program built from scratch! During this exercise I practiced creating/ calling functions and using loops. I created the logic for JavaScript first and then created the HTML and manipulated the DOM to give the game a UI. A primary takeaway was declaring variables and figuring out what needed to be in scope vs global. 


### Continued development

#### Javascript
While I think the JS code I wrote is higly readable, I'm curious as to how I can write more efficient code. Could I have used any arrow or anonyous functions? Could any of these if/else loops have been switch statments? 


### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/) - This is an amazing site that I keep on deck for basic JS methods and functions. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
