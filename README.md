## My process

### Built with

- JavaScript

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

#### JavaScript
This is my first JavaScript program built from scratch! During this exercise I practiced creating/ calling function and using loops. A primary takeaway was declaring variables and figuring out what needed to be in scope vs global. 


### Continued development

#### Javascript
While I think the JS code I wrote is higly readable, I'm curious as to how I can write more efficient code. Could I have used any arrow or anonyous functions? Could any of these if/else loops have been switch statments? 


### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Cheatsheet](https://htmlcheatsheet.com/js/) - This is an amazing site that I keep on deck for basic JS methods and functions. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**
